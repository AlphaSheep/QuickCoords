How to Contribute
=================

QuickCoords is open source software, so if you feel that you can contribute to QuickCoords in any way, please do so. It doesn't matter whether you want to find and report bugs, submit bug fixes, write documentation, or add new features, your contributions are welcome. These guidelines describe how you can go about doing this.

Reporting Issues
----------------

Whether they are major or minor bugs, annoyances, or just something not doing exactly what you expect, any issues can be reported using the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Sylvermyst-Technologies/QuickCoords/issues). However, before you submit your issue, please make sure you do the following:

1. Check that the issue hasn't already been reported.
2. If possible, try to describe a minimal test case to reproduce the issue.
3. Share as much information as possible. That is, your OS, console output, and any other information that may be important.
 
Documentation
-------------

[There is a wiki](https://github.com/Sylvermyst-Technologies/QuickCoords/wiki), but it is empty at the moment. If you feel you can contribute to it, then please do so. Please use correct grammar. It does not matter whether you use American or British spelling, but please ensure that spelling is consistent on any single page. That is, a page may use either American or British spelling, but not a mixture of both.

Code Contributions
------------------

New features are welcome, so long as they do not interfere with the basic workflow. The idea is to have a program that launches quickly, requires minimal setup time, and may be used to read coordinates from an image, or a series of potentially hundreds of images (this is important), in as short a time as possible.

Please try to keep a consistent coding style.
* Use 4 spaces for indents. No tabs.
* Avoid polluting namespaces. i.e. use ``` import math``` or ``` from math import sin, cos```, rather than ``` from math import *```.
* Comment if it is not immediately obvious what a section of code is for.
* Use descriptive variable and function names.
* Where possible, follow the Zen of Python (``` import this```).
* Every function, class and module needs a docstring.

You may contribute code by sending a pull request, or by posting code snippets to the issue tracker, or even just eail them to us.
